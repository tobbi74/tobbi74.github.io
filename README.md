#Project Name: 30MFF Website

#Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create:
  This project is to create a website for an imagined film festival. During the first week of the course Communication Lab at New York University Abu Dhabi, Spring 2021, we have to shoot a short film without any prior script, and without an in-person meeting. Therefore, we want to recreate the environment of Zoom, the application that we used during the pandemic. The movie is shot within 15 minutes and is edited within 15 minutes.
  The film portrays a common image during the pandemic: Zoom University. Due to the lockdown, every activity is moving on to Zoom. We cannot attend in-person class, thus the film is shot through Zoom. We cannot gather, thus we play and hang out with each other through Zoom. We cannot do even the simplest activity such as borrowing a pencil or an eraser in person, thus we portray doing them through Zoom. Everyone is stuck within the box of Zoom.
  To portray the restriction within Zoom, I design my website as a more static website, so that the viewers don't have a lot of control over what they can do, the same situation during the pandemic. Watching the video at the top of the web page, you cannot move forward or backward to see the video. Instead, you have to watch the video without any control except the play/pause control. This shows the restrictions we all face during the pandemic.
   
#Process: How did you go about implementing the concept:
  To create a restriction on the video control, I eliminate the default control bar on the video in the .html file. Instead, I create only a play/pause button using jQuery. This way, the viewer cannot go back or forward to see the video, they cannot adjust the volume or zoom the screen to fullscreen. These restrictions are meant to make them feel uncomfortable, just like how the pandemic and social distancing make them feel. 
  On the other hand, the website creates some smalls convenience, such as the website will direct you to the part in the menu when clicking on the title on the menu; when you hover on the images of the crew's members, it will show some information about them. Plus, everything can be found on one page, you won't be directed to another page. 

#Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version:
  I am really happy with the design of the website, with simple and clean colors and layout, and they are exactly what my mock-up on Adobe Xd looks like. Thus, I think I am successful in recreating what I imagined about the look of the website. I also manage to implement the restrictions I want to create (the video controls, the interactions).
  However, there are some small problems that I want to learn how to fix.
  1) Responsive layout: When I minimize the website to a certain size, the picture in the 'About' section shrinks in width, I haven't found out a way to shrink it proportionally. 
  2) I don't know how to make each section (About/Crew/Contact) expands itself when I minimize the window. 
  Most of the problems are related to the responsive layout, thus I want to learn more about that.
